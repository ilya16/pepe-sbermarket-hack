## Problem statement

***Task:*** Predict which products customers will buy next time.

***Metric:*** `MAP@K` with `K=50`.

## Solution

***Hypethesis:*** People tend to buy the same products and have preferences. 

***Idea***: Use information about most frequently bought products to make future predictions.

Final [solution](main_solution.ipynb) is a two-step prediction model:

1. Top user products sorted by
  * total number of product purchases
  * date of the last order
  * average position in all orders
2. Collaborative Filtering based on `implicit.nearest_neighbours.CosineRecommender` to recommend and fill remaining predictions in a list of K=50 ranked predictions. The model is trained on normalized `(user, product)` interactions for all users in the provided data.

Additionally, we crafted user and product features to build a two-level recommendation system: candidate recommendation + ranking. This repository provides only the feature crafting code and data insights.
